## Abstract

This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of an AI-powered thesis management system that assists students in planning, organizing, and executing their academic research projects. The system integrates multiple artificial intelligence providers (local Llama models via Ollama and Google Gemini) with a comprehensive web-based platform that includes automated timeline generation, task management, and 18 specialized academic tools. Our implementation features a Next.js/React frontend with TypeScript, a FastAPI backend with Python, and integrations with Notion for project management and Gmail for progress notifications. The system addresses common challenges in academic project management by providing AI-assisted brainstorming, granular task breakdown, real-time progress tracking, and ethical AI usage monitoring. Through iterative development and testing, we created a fully functional application that demonstrates the potential of AI integration in educational technology. The resulting platform significantly reduces the cognitive load of thesis planning while maintaining academic integrity through built-in ethics tracking. Our work contributes to the growing field of AI-enhanced educational tools and provides a practical solution for students managing complex, long-term academic projects.

## 1. Introduction

The process of completing a thesis or dissertation represents one of the most challenging academic endeavors students face. The complexity of managing literature reviews, research methodologies, data collection, analysis, and writing over extended periods often overwhelms students, leading to procrastination, poor time management, high rate of mental health issues during thesis writing, such as sleep loss, depression, and academic stress. Traditional project management tools, while helpful for general tasks, lack the specialized features needed for scholarly research workflows.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), present new opportunities to address these challenges. AI systems can assist with various aspects of academic work, from brainstorming research topics to generating structured timelines, polishing academic writing styles, and providing specialized research tools. However, the integration of AI into academic workflows raises important questions about academic integrity, appropriate usage, and the balance between assistance and independent work. As a result, lots of universities tend to be very conservative in using AI in case of making student lose their independent critical thinking skills. 

This paper describes the development of a comprehensive AI-powered thesis management system designed to address these challenges while maintaining academic integrity. Our system, called "Thesis Helper," provides students with intelligent planning assistance, automated task generation, specialized academic tools, and integrated project management capabilities. The platform supports both local AI models (for privacy) and cloud-based services (for performance), allowing users to choose their preferred approach based on their needs and institutional policies.

The primary research questions addressed in this work include: (1) How can AI be effectively integrated into academic project management workflows? (2) What specialized tools are most beneficial for students working on thesis projects? (3) How can we ensure ethical AI usage while providing meaningful assistance? Our implementation demonstrates practical solutions to these questions through a full-stack web application that has been iteratively developed and tested.

## 2. Materials & Methods

### 2.1 System Architecture

The Thesis Helper system follows a modern web application architecture with clear separation between frontend, backend, and external service integrations. The frontend is built using Next.js 14 with React 18 and TypeScript, providing a responsive and type-safe user interface. Styling is implemented using Tailwind CSS for rapid development and consistent design patterns.

The backend utilizes FastAPI (Python) with SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations and Pydantic for data validation. The system employs SQLite for development and can be easily configured for PostgreSQL in production environments. Asynchronous programming patterns are used throughout to handle concurrent AI model interactions and external API calls efficiently.

### 2.2 AI Integration Framework

Two primary AI providers are integrated to offer flexibility in deployment scenarios:

**Local AI (Ollama):** For privacy-conscious users and institutions, we integrated Ollama to run Llama models locally. This approach ensures that sensitive academic content never leaves the user's environment while providing full AI capabilities.

**Cloud AI (Google Gemini):** For users requiring maximum performance, Google Gemini API integration provides access to state-of-the-art language models with faster response times and potentially higher quality outputs.

The AI service layer abstracts these providers behind a common interface, allowing seamless switching between local and cloud-based models based on user preferences or institutional requirements.

### 2.3 Core Features Implementation

**Brainstorming Module:** Interactive chat interface for thesis topic development, utilizing conversation history to suggest topic finalization when sufficient context is gathered.

**Timeline Generation:** AI-powered analysis of user requirements (thesis field, deadline, available hours, work patterns) to generate detailed project timelines with granular task breakdown and realistic time estimates.

**Task Management:** Integration with Notion API for professional project management, including automated workspace creation, task synchronization, and progress tracking.

**Academic Tools Suite:** Implementation of 18 specialized tools including grammar checking, web search and fact-checking, Wikipedia lookup, citation generation, PDF summarization, mathematical equation solving, and academic integrity monitoring.

### 2.4 Ethical AI Monitoring

An ethics tracking system monitors AI usage patterns, provides academic integrity guidance, and maintains usage logs to ensure responsible AI assistance throughout the academic process.

### 2.5 Data Persistence and State Management

The system implements comprehensive project persistence using SQLAlchemy models for thesis projects, phases, tasks, and milestones. Frontend state management utilizes React hooks and session storage for temporary data, with automatic synchronization to the backend for permanent storage.

### 2.6 Human Feedback Reinforcement Learning

Based on the student and advisor feedback, our agent should intelligently pass to the student work routine and advisors thesis plans.

### 3.5 Ethics and Academic Integrity

The ethics monitoring system successfully tracks AI usage patterns and provides appropriate guidance to users about academic integrity considerations. Usage logs demonstrate responsible AI assistance that enhances rather than replaces student work.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Effectiveness of AI Integration

Our implementation demonstrates that AI can be effectively integrated into academic workflows when properly designed with appropriate guardrails. The dual AI provider approach successfully addresses different user needs, with local models providing privacy and cloud models offering performance. The key insight is that AI works best as an intelligent assistant rather than a replacement for critical thinking and academic work.

### 4.2 Specialized Academic Tools Impact

The 18-tool suite addresses real academic workflow needs that general-purpose AI cannot adequately handle. Tools like citation generation, grammar checking, and research paper discovery provide immediate practical value, while more advanced capabilities like mathematical equation solving and survey design assist with specialized research requirements. The modular tool architecture allows for easy expansion based on user feedback and emerging needs.

### 4.3 Project Management Integration Benefits

Notion integration provides professional-grade project management capabilities that significantly enhance the academic planning process. The automated workspace creation eliminates setup friction while providing students with industry-standard project management tools. This integration bridges the gap between academic planning and real-world project management skills.

### 4.4 Ethical Considerations and Academic Integrity

The ethics monitoring system addresses a critical concern in AI-assisted academic work. By tracking usage patterns and providing guidance, the system helps maintain academic integrity while allowing beneficial AI assistance. This approach demonstrates that ethical AI usage can be built into the system architecture rather than treated as an afterthought.

### 4.5 Technical Architecture Decisions

The choice of modern web technologies (Next.js, FastAPI, TypeScript) provides a solid foundation for future development while ensuring maintainability and scalability. The modular architecture allows for easy integration of new AI models, academic tools, and external services as they become available.


### 4.6 Limitations and Areas for Improvement

Current limitations include dependency on external AI services for cloud functionality, potential privacy concerns with cloud AI models, and the need for ongoing maintenance as academic APIs evolve. Future improvements could include offline AI capabilities, integration with institutional learning management systems, and expanded language support for international users.

In addition, the reinforcement learning fails to be integrated into our final project since lots of technical difficulities.
